# services-api
The REST API responsible for enabling shops to manage their services offerings and users to search them

## Running locally ##

1 - To run this API locally you should first create a python virtual environment with:

```
$ python3.7 -m venv venv
```

2 - And then enter it:

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

3 - Now you can install the project's dependencies:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4 - Fill the .env file with the environment variables and theirs values; the variables you'll need are in the .env-example file; Export them using:

```
$ export $(cat .env | xargs)
```

5 - Finally, start the application:

```
$ python3.7 -m services.app
```
